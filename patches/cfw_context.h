/* Persistent CFW-owned state that must survive image-container teardown/rebuild.
 * The image container (its display buffer A @ state+0x8 and recon buffer B @
 * state+0xc) is freed and reallocated on rebuild. The packed shadow lives in A
 * only for the lifetime of the current streaming layout and must be seeded by a
 * mode-6 keyframe after every rebuild. The bookkeeping that does
 * need to survive rebuilds is anchored by a pointer in 1 KiB of SRAM explicitly
 * removed from the top of the stock primary TLSF arena by patch_compress.py. The
 * stock arena is [0x202728a8,0x2029f8a8); the patched size is 0x2cc00, reserving
 * [0x2029f4a8,0x2029f8a8) for CFW. Its first word holds the context pointer and
 * its second holds a magic-guarded sticky allocation-failure diagnostic. This is
 * deliberately carved out rather than
 * inferred padding: 0x20003ffc, used before EVENCFW/11, is actually the +0 callback
 * of the BLE-RX lifecycle object and stock code can BLX through it. The struct's
 * `magic` guards against warm-reset garbage; the slot ptr is range-checked before
 * dereference. */
