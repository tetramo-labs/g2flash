/* ---- RLE over 4bpp pixels (the inner layer of modes 3 and 6) ----------------
 *
 * See the RLE paragraph at the top of the file for the token format. The decoder is a
 * byte-at-a-time state machine that consumes the image handler's RLE payload,
 * writing pixels into a
 * rectangular 4bpp destination: `rows` rows of `rowbytes` bytes, row r at
 * base + r*stride. For mode 6 that's the whole shadow; for mode 3 it's the box within
 * it (rowbytes < stride). Runs cross rows freely — the nibble stream is the wire
 * order, not per-row.
 *
 * `left` counts the nibbles still expected; the decode is complete only when it hits
 * exactly 0 with no token half-parsed. Overrunning it (or running past the last row)
 * sets `err` and the caller drops the frame. */
