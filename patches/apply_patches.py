"""
Apply a committed CFW patch set (patches/cfw_patches.json) to the stock G2
firmware image. This is the clang-free half of the build: it takes the stock
base image plus a JSON list of (offset, expected-old-bytes, new-bytes) patches
and writes the patched image. No compiler, no C sources, nothing but stdlib —
so it runs anywhere Python does, including on a phone.

The patch JSON is produced by patches/gen_patches.py (which DOES need clang) and
committed to git, so the exact reviewed image can be rebuilt on any machine
without reproducing clang's byte-for-byte output.

Usage:
  python3 apply_patches.py <base.bin> <patches.json> <out.bin>

JSON schema (see gen_patches.py):
  {
    "base":          "g2_2.3.0.24.bin",
    "base_sha256":   "<hex>",              # verified against <base.bin> up front
    "output_sha256": "<hex>",              # verified against <out.bin> at the end
    "patches": [
      {"offset": <int>, "old": "<hex>", "new": "<hex>", "desc": "..."},
      ...
      # the final patch is usually an append: "old" is "" and "offset" == len(base)
    ]
  }

Each patch writes `new` at `offset` after checking the bytes already there equal
`old` (a stock-image sanity check + double-apply guard). A patch whose `old` is
empty writes at (or extends) the end of the file — that's how the appended code
blob is represented.
