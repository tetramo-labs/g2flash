"""
Generate the committed CFW patch set (patches/cfw_patches.json) from the stock
G2 firmware image. This is the clang half of the build: it compiles the injected
code blobs (via patch_compress.build_patch_ops -> build.py -> clang) and writes a
JSON list of (offset, expected-old-bytes, new-bytes) patches plus the base and
output SHA-256s.

The resulting JSON is committed to git and is the source of truth for the build.
apply_patches.py replays it onto the stock image with no compiler at all, so the
exact reviewed firmware can be rebuilt on any machine — including ones that can't
run a matching clang cross-compiler (a phone, a fresh CI box, etc.). Because the
op list is derived from clang output, a different clang version will produce a
different JSON; that's expected, and it's why the JSON — not the compiler — is the
committed artifact.

Usage:
  python3 gen_patches.py <base.bin> <out.json>

Regenerate the committed patch set after changing any of the injected C sources:
  python3 patches/gen_patches.py g2_2.3.0.24.bin patches/cfw_patches.json
(then update OUT_SHA256 in build_cfw.sh if the output hash changed, and commit).
