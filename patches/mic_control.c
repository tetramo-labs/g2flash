/*
 * Microphone-control + multi-channel routing CFW extension for the G2
 * (SybilSight "glasses -> microphones").
 *
 * TOPOLOGY. Each temple is its own Apollo510 and its own BLE endpoint, and each
 * temple carries a PAIR of microphones (front + rear along the temple). So the
 * system is two independent 2-mic arrays: the phone connects to Left and Right
 * separately and receives at most 2 channels from each. There is no shared audio
 * hardware between temples, so each temple captures, encodes, and streams its own
 * pair on its own clock and its own link. The phone reassembles the four channels
 * and does array processing (beamforming / noise isolation / direction detection,
 * fused with the compass + IMU heading it already receives) itself.
 *
 * STOCK PIPELINE (openCFW recovery of the original g2_2.2.6.10 image; every
 * callable entry below was re-matched against g2_2.2.9.22 by its complete
 * normalized function body). The behavior is pinned by the manifests in
 * evenRealities-openCFW/g2/tools/manifests/g2-service-audio-*.tsv,
 * g2-service-algo-*.tsv, and g2-production-mic-*.tsv, with the narrative in
 * g2/docs/research/g2-service-audio-recovery.md, g2-service-algo-recovery.md,
 * and g2-production-mic-recovery.md):
 *   service_audio.c          0x005930F8...             two PCM app slots + LC3
 *   service_algo_process     0x005adf18                per-frame SSR + TDOA angle
 *   production mic init      0x005ab8ca...0x005A8E6E codec/PDM, mono/stereo
 *   drv_pdm_production.c      follows service_audio    Ambiq PDM capture driver
 * The stock two-channel capture already exists (codec front end, stereo callback,
 * source slot 0), and service_algo_process already returns a signed
 * TDOA angle + SSR per frame -- the bearing a beamformer wants. What stock lacks,
 * and this file adds, is (a) a control plane so the phone can choose front end /
 * channels / rate / codec / bitrate, and (b) a routing path that forwards BOTH
 * channels (instead of the stock mono average) plus the angle and a timestamp, so
 * the phone can beamform.
 *
 * CONTRACT. Rides the already-wired sid-0x09 settings hooks (settings_send_wrapper
 * / settings_decode_wrapper), so NO new binary patch offsets are introduced -- the
 * injected blob just grows and gen_patches.py recomputes sizes/checksums.

 *                    framesLo..framesHi(32), effRateLo, effRateHi]
 *     `rate`/`br` echo the REQUESTED values; `effRate` is what capture actually
 *     runs at (see EFFECTIVE vs REQUESTED below). `sideId`: 1 = right temple,
 *     2 = left temple.
 *
 * The phone sends an IDENTICAL CONFIGURE to both temples for a consistent array;
 * each temple answers field 104 on its own link so SybilSight can confirm they
 * match before enabling its radar-style beam view.
 *
 * MULTI-CHANNEL STREAM FRAME (glasses -> phone, via the stock streaming-notify
 * BLE facade), fixed 21-byte header:
 *   [0]  'S'   [1] 'M'   [2] ver=1
 *   [3]  flags       config MIC_FLAG_* bits, plus bit7 = payload truncated
 *   [4]  seqLo  [5] seqHi        (low 16 bits of the frame counter)
 *   [6..9]  tick     u32 LE, this temple's 1 ms OS tick at packetization
 *   [10] nCh         channels in the payload (1 or 2)
 *   [11..12] rateDiv u16 LE, EFFECTIVE sample rate in units of 100 Hz
 *   [13] fmt         PCM width code as configured (0=16/1=24/2=32-bit)
 *   [14] codec       what the payload ACTUALLY is (0 = LC3, 1 = raw PCM)
 *   [15..16] angle   s16 LE, on-device TDOA angle (degrees; 0 if not computed)
 *   [17..18] ssr     s16 LE, on-device SSR ratio (0 if not computed)
 *   [19..20] payLen  u16 LE, payload bytes that follow
 * `tick` gives coarse host-side L/R alignment; `angle`/`ssr` are this temple's
 * own-pair estimate (only computed when MIC_FLAG_BEAMFORM is set AND the frame
 * is 2-channel 16-bit -- the recovered algo object expects interleaved stereo
 * 16-bit input). CHANNEL LAYOUT CAVEAT: the recovered stereo production callback
 * dispatches the two channels as back-to-back 400-byte blocks (concatenated, not
 * interleaved) when channel extraction is enabled, and forwards the raw source
 * buffer when it is not. The payload is the dispatched buffer verbatim; which
 * layout a live session produces is a validation-gate item -- confirm on
 * hardware and pin it in the SybilSight demuxer.
 *
 * EFFECTIVE vs REQUESTED. The recovered init entries take no rate/width/bitrate
 * arguments -- stock capture runs the LC3 voice pipeline's fixed 16 kHz. The
 * requested rate/bitrate are therefore stored and echoed (so the UI round-trips
 * user intent) but capture runs at MIC_RATE_DEFAULT until the codec/PDM
 * reconfiguration seams are recovered; stream frames carry the EFFECTIVE rate,
 * which is the one the host DSP must trust. Likewise a requested codec=LC3 keeps
 * streaming raw PCM (frame byte 14 says so) until the on-device per-channel
 * LC3 encode path (SVC_Lc3EncodeMono) has a validated ABI: raw
 * frames always carry the true multi-channel samples the beamformer needs, so
 * "best quality" is the default rather than a failure mode.
 *
 * STREAMING LEASE (fail-open, same paradigm as the wake + framebuffer leases).
 * An armed session is only kept alive while the phone renews it: CONFIGURE and
 * RENEW both push the deadline MIC_LEASE_MS out and (re)arm a one-shot osTimer
 * watchdog. If the phone disappears, mic_pcm_tap stops emitting immediately at
 * the deadline (cheap signed tick compare) and the watchdog tears the capture
 * hardware down from the RTOS timer thread. Mode-11 session cleanup
 * (cfw_cleanup_session) also tears the session down, so a departing custom app
 * cannot leave the mics running.
 *
 * SAFETY / STATUS. A CONFIGURE without MIC_FLAG_ARM_HW only stores and advertises
 * the configuration -- it touches no audio hardware and cannot fault. The capture
 * + streaming path (mic_session_start / mic_pcm_tap / mic_session_stop) is
 * compiled in but runs ONLY when the phone sets MIC_FLAG_ARM_HW, and every
 * firmware entry it uses is an address-pinned but ABI-INFERRED seam (the tap
 * callback signature, the codec-init channel selector, and the streaming-notify
 * sender args are recovered behaviourally, not to register level). Those seams
 * MUST be confirmed on sacrificial hardware before a phone build ships with
 * ARM_HW enabled. Self-contained: no external symbols, no writable globals;
 * state lives in the customCfwContext singleton, guarded by magic + bounds.
