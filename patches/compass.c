/* 2.2.9.22: capture the GAF output before DRV_IMUDataParserCallback clears it.
 * The stock parser can select GRV, GMRV, or RV into the same quaternion slot.
 * Keep a timestamp-keyed sidecar for each of its 20 records; sampling and report
 * selection both run on the sensor-hub task. Never infer the source later from
 * a global that may already describe a newer sample.
 *
 * Replace the heading-report call at 0x004b8212, preserving its stock UI event,
 * and send one sid-8 command-15 notification directly. This replaces the old
 * CFW global-display forwarding hook (it must not also emit a second heading).
 * Stock Navigation remains untouched. The sender copies its stack payload.
 *
 * Root protobuf field 100 is an optional 12-byte diagnostic extension:
 *   'C','M',1, accuracy, anomalies, source, flags,0, sample_ms_LE32.
 * accuracy/anomalies: 0..3 / 0..2; 255 = unavailable.
 * source: 0 none/unknown, 1 GRV, 2 GMRV, 3 RV.
 * flags: bit7 matching capture, bit0 GRV valid, bit1 GMRV + heading valid,
 * bit2 RV + heading valid, bit3 fresh magnetic bias/flags in this GAF frame.
 * Magnetic flags otherwise carry the driver's last known values.

/* DRV_IMUSetSensorParameters, 2.2.9.22, at 0x4b4c76:
 *   movs r1,#0; strb r1,[r0]
 * r0 points at the driver's magnetic accuracy byte (0x20077380). The next
 * instructions reload it into r2 and call the vendor bias-restoration API
 * with the driver's cached bias. That API restores covariance as well as bias.
 *
 * Replace only this reset with a BL. Return the pointer in r0; r1/r2/r3 are
 * overwritten before use, flags are dead, and LR is saved by the stock prologue.
 * Preserve the current accuracy, including zero/downgrades, rather than a
 * historical maximum. The stock FIFO parser continues updating bias/accuracy.
 *
 * Read the framebuffer (session) lease without cfw_fb_lease_active(): its
 * expiration path frees display resources, which this sensor-task hook must
 * not do. No allocation, sensor I/O, or state restoration occurs here. A missing
 * context, released/expired lease, or invalid accuracy uses the stock reset.
 * Do not gate on compass_forward: stopping reports may itself reconfigure IMU.
