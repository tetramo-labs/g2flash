Build a CFW image for g2_2.2.9.22 with:
  (1) the 576x288 image-container size lift (the same 3 edits that
      the earlier standalone image-container patch used),
  (2) the zlib image glue (multi-mode load_image_z, incl. keepalive kick + buzzer),
      entered at image_deferred,
  (3) a CFW capability-advertisement field (protobuf field 100) plus a private,
      fail-open Faceclaw wake-ownership lease on sid=0x09,
  (4) conditional idle-double-tap dashboard deferral and conditional stock
      Even-AI suppression while that lease is valid, and
  (5) Faceclaw-lease-gated source-qualified long-press, release, and 2.2.9
      tap-then-long-press forwarding, and
  (6) a full-panel 640x480 packed-4bpp shadow copied directly into the physical
      framebuffer, and
  (7) stock wear-state notifications outside onboarding plus a current-state query, and
  (8) Faceclaw compass heading + sample diagnostics from the sensor hub while
      image-handler mode 10 is enabled, and
  (9) a lease-scoped 64 KiB texture cache plus cached-image/cached-string drawing
      through image-handler modes 12, 13, and 14, and built-in-font mode 15, and
  (10) a phone-controlled microphone configuration + multi-channel audio streaming
      channel (settings fields 103/104 + the 'SM' stream frame) riding the
      already-hooked sid-0x09 settings seams -- no new patch sites; see
      mic_control.c for the contract and its hardware validation gate, and
  (11) LE 2M support, a 7.5 ms / latency-0 fast connection profile, and persistent
      fast-mode requests so the stock 60-second slow-mode timer cannot throttle
      custom image traffic, and
  (12) an ANCS relay (sid-0x09 fields 125/126) that retargets four `bl` sites
      inside the stock ANCC profile object so the right lens forwards every iOS
      notification it receives (source event, attributes, app display name) to
      the phone; see ancs_relay.c for the contract and threading model.

REBASED 2.2.6.10 -> 2.2.9.22 (2026-08-22). Every address below was re-derived with
normalized function/site matching and checked against the 2.2.9.22 disassembly. Two
changed hosts needed semantic rebases: image completion moved into a shared helper, and
plain long-press no longer calls the old force-quit dialog. Two things are worth
remembering if this is ever rebased again:
  * a patch site's offset within its host function is NOT stable -- Even inserts code, so
    each site was located by instruction-window match (firmware/find_site.py) and then
    confirmed by decoding its `bl` target, not by extrapolating from the function entry;
  * hardcoded RAM addresses all moved, with several DIFFERENT deltas, and some old
    addresses still exist in the new image as unrelated variables. They were re-derived
    through the instruction that loads them (firmware/map_ram.py).

PLACEMENT MODEL — APPEND, don't overwrite. The injected code blobs
(zlib glue, settings wrapper, gesture_fwd) are APPENDED to
the tail of the main-app component (ota/s200_firmware_ota.bin) rather than being
squeezed into a reclaimed dead function. The bootloader XIP-programs the whole
main-app payload to 0x00438000, so a byte at payload offset K lands at MRAM
0x438000 + K - 0x20; appended blobs therefore load into MRAM immediately after the
current app image (~0x007bea64 on 2.2.9.22), with hundreds of KB of headroom before the
OTA flag at 0x007fe000. This removes the old ~2 KB dead-region ceiling.

Appending changes the image size, so this script fixes up every size/offset field
the container + bootloader read: the component's subheader payload size (ps), its
TOC entry size (ps + 128), the main-app preamble length field (preamble[0] low
24 bits — what the bootloader actually erases/programs), and then the checksums
(component CRC32C in the TOC + subheader echo, and the preamble zlib-CRC32). The
main app is the LAST component so appending shifts no downstream offsets.

Every `bl` that targets injected code is computed from (call-site, appended
address) so redirects can never drift; the injected code itself is fully position-
independent (see build.py) and needs no load address at build time, so it compiles
in a single pass. A hard MRAM-ceiling check (duplicating g2flash.py's
check_mainapp_fits_mram) refuses an oversized image.
