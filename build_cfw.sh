# build_cfw.sh — one-shot setup + custom-firmware build for Even Realities G2.
#
# Does everything needed to go from a fresh clone to a flashable image:
#   1. creates a Python virtualenv (./venv) and installs the flasher's deps
#   2. downloads the stock G2 2.2.9.22 firmware from Even's CDN
#   3. verifies the download hashes as expected (refuses to proceed otherwise)
#   4. applies the committed patch set (patches/cfw_patches.json) to the stock
#      image to produce the CFW image
#   5. verifies the patched image hashes as expected
#
# The patch set is split into two halves:
#   * patches/gen_patches.py compiles the injected code with clang and emits the
#     committed patches/cfw_patches.json (a list of offset/old/new byte patches).
#   * patches/apply_patches.py replays that JSON onto the stock image with NO
#     compiler — pure Python stdlib, so it runs anywhere (a phone, a fresh box).
# The build always APPLIES the committed JSON, so the pinned output hash is met
# regardless of what clang is (or isn't) installed. When a working clang cross-
# compiler is present we additionally REGENERATE the patch set and check it still
# matches the committed one — a reproducibility check. If clang is missing or
# can't cross-compile, we warn and skip that check rather than failing.
#
# The stock firmware is Even's, so we don't redistribute it — it's fetched at
# build time and patched locally. The build is fully deterministic: the committed
# JSON + the pinned output hash mean a successful run reproduces exactly the
# reviewed image.
#
# Usage:
#   ./build_cfw.sh                  # full setup + build
#   ./build_cfw.sh --skip-venv      # build only, don't touch the venv
#   ./build_cfw.sh --force-download # re-download the stock image even if cached
#   ./build_cfw.sh --update-patches # regenerate & OVERWRITE patches/cfw_patches.json
#                                   #   from clang (use after editing patch sources)
#   ./build_cfw.sh --help
#
# WARNING: flashing custom firmware voids your warranty and can brick the
# glasses. This script only BUILDS the image; see README.md for flashing.
